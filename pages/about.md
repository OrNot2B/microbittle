## Studies
I majored in Computer Science in ShanghaiTech University, during which I became fancinated with game development and I took two courses learning basic game engines. Ever since I have been coding some games and tools in Unity and UE4 with C# or C++. I also took part in some game jams, and my team was in top-15 in Netease 2019 Mini Game Contest. 

## Internships
In 2019 summer, I was working as a game design intern at Tencent's Morefun Studio on _FairyTail: The Magic Shooter_. I get to familiarize with the job of online game designers during this expeirence. 

In 2020 summer, I worked as a game development engineer intern at _NetEASE Interactive Entertainment_. During this I wrote a plugin and helped transform cinematic sequences and animations from their NeoX Engine to UE4.
