Hi! My name is Yuchen Xie, and I go by Robin. I'm a current graduate studying at **Entertainment Technology Center** of **Carnegie Mellon University.**

## Studies
I majored in Computer Science in ShanghaiTech University, during which I became fancinated with game development and I took two courses learning basic game engines. Ever since I have been coding some games and tools in Unity and UE4 with C# or C++.
