### Unity + Quest2   Rhythm Game

In Dream Guardian, player plays someone that guard the sleeping kids from the dream-eatting little monsters. If the monsters reach the kids, they will do bad dreams and even start crying. The goal is to protect the kids from the monsters by hitting the monster with a hammer controlled by ropes. As the game is a rhythm game, it will be easier for the player to listen to the beats and follow the flow.

I mainly coded the rhythm system, including node generating and combo calculation.
