### Unity + Hololens2   AR Game

In Love at Tea Sight, players works in a milk tea shop and mix drinks accroding to customer's needs. It's a hololens game, so we actually gave players a table and an iPad for instructions. Players get to pick up fruits, tea, milk, other ingredients and blend them while looking at the instructions through the hololens.

I mainly coded the hololens interaction parts as well as the blending system.
