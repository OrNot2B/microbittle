### Unity + Quest2 + Handtracking   Writing Game

The story is about the consequences of war. The player plays Evelyn, whose husband Henry has gone to the war. Unsure about what the future holds for them, their only way of communication is letters. The player only gets to read and write letters and send packages to Henry. We're trying to find a balance on the player between having limited interactions and focusing to the letters.

I coded the interactions for Quest hand-tracking, which is a little complicated since we want players can grab and open envelopes at the same time. I also coded the letter generating system and packing system.
