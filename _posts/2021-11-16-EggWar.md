### Unity + Vive Tracker + 3D Rudder   Festival Multiplayer Game

Egg war is designed as a festival game. We want to engage as many people as possible and we also want the gameplay to be simple and easy to understand. Two players play the chickens. Their job is to keep the chicken by flapping their arm, and rob as many eggs as possible. Two audience can also take part in it and play as the cloud/primive and they get to mess the chickens a little.

I programmed all the controllers, reborn mechanism of the chicken, egg calculation as well as the enemy generation.
